# TSP
The Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) is an NP-Hard problem in combinatorial optimization. The algorithm I have designed here finds a solution with about 93% accuracy for a city diagram of over 100 cities in under 5 minutes with 1000 chromosomes and 600 generations. It is a genetic algorithm using an annealing schedule (Simulated Annealing). Therefore, its transition states follow the Markov process.
